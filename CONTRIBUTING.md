# Contributing to EJAF
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.
A typical workflow is to start a discussion about bugs or new features in a Github Issue, and work together with us to choose a strategy for a fix or enhancement. We recommend that all code changes are submitted via a Pull Request so we can go over the review process and apply the necessary changes. Please keep the PRs small so they are easy to understand and quick to review.
